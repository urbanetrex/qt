Week 1: 2^101-1
Week 2: -1 -2
Week 3: 10 100 100
Week 4: 123 2 123
Week 5: a+b a-b
Week 6: Imagine a square which area is a^2. Then, cut off a square area b^2. This is a^2-b^2. 
You can cut off a rectangle near the cut-off square side, with an area of (a-b)b, then the left-off rectangle's area is (a-b)a.
Put the cut-off rectangle to the left-off. The area is (a+b)(a-b), which is the answer of a^2-b^2.
Week 7: 1-1/8=7/8
Week 8: 2^a+2^(a+1)+2^(a+2)+...+2^(n-1) = 2^n-2^a
Week 9: 3^2*(3^4-1)/2 = 360
Week 10: 5^2*(5^5-1)/4 = 19,525
NOTE: The answers in Week 9 and Week 10 are partically AI-generated.
Week 11 Question: a+aq+aq^2+aq^3+...+aq^(n-1)
Week 11 (qâ‰ 1): (q^n-1)a/q-1
Week 11 (q=1): nq
